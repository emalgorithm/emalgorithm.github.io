<!-- I am a PostDoc researcher with Emanuele Rodolà in the [Gladia](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it) group at the Sapienza University of Rome. I'm interested in AI for Animal Communication, and more specifically in how we can use (multimodal) AI to decode what wild animals are saying to each other, and what that can tell us about their consciusness and intelligence, and, ultimately, deepening our understanding of the living world.

Before this, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at [Vant AI](https://www.vant.ai/), where I focused on **generative models for structural biology and drug discovery** (see **[Neo-1](https://www.vant.ai/neo-1)**).

Before this, I earned my PhD between Twitter and Imperial College London, working on **Graph Neural Networks** under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein). During my PhD, I also worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter, focusing on both foundamental research and applied product problems. Prior to that, I was part of Fabula AI, a startup creating deep learning technology for fake news detection, subsequently [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai) in 2019. My educational background includes an undergraduate degree from Imperial College London and a master's degree from the University of Cambridge, both in Computer Science.

Outside of machine learning, you'll find me scuba diving, hiking trails, or simply enjoying quiet moments in nature. -->

I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the [Gladia](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it) group at **Sapienza University of Rome**, working with [Emanuele Rodolà](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/authors/rodola/). My research explores how **AI can help decode animal communication**, focusing on how multimodal models can reveal what wild animals communicate to one another, what this tells us about their intelligence and consciousness, and how such understanding can reshape our relationship with the natural world.

Before turning my attention to animal communication, I worked at [Vant AI](https://www.vant.ai/), developing **[generative models for structural biology and drug discovery](https://www.vant.ai/neo-1)**, and earned my PhD between **Imperial College London** and **Twitter**, supervised by [Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein) and focusing on **Graph Neural Networks**. Earlier, I was part of **Fabula AI**, a deep learning startup for fake news detection that was [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai). I hold degrees in Computer Science from **Imperial College London** and the **University of Cambridge**.

Outside research, I love scuba diving, hiking, and quiet moments in nature.
