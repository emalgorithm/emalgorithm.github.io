Forbes Italy published an [article](https://forbes.it/2020/03/01/stage-da-google-o-alla-nasa-con-leadthefuture-idea-di-tre-ragazzi-italiani/) about LeadTheFuture, the mentoring non-profit which I co-founded. Soon after, my cofounders and I were also included in the 100 under 30 by Forbes Italy on the most talented young leaders in the country.
