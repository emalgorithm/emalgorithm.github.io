## Supervision and Mentoring

One of the most rewarding aspects of research for me is the opportunity to supervise and mentor bright, motivated students. I am deeply grateful for the curiosity and creativity they bring, and for how much I learn from them in return.

Below is a list of students I have had the pleasure to supervise.
If you are a **prospective student interested in working with me**, I encourage you to reach out to some of my former mentees to get a sense of my mentoring style and what our collaboration might look like.
