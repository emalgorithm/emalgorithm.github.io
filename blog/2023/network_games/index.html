In <em>network games</em><d-footnote>See <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GamesNetworks.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Games on Networks</a><d-cite key="jackson2014games"></d-cite> for an overview.</d-footnote> the players are connected in a network (graph), and the outcome of the game depends not only on the players’ strategies but also on the structure of the network. Each player tries to maximise their <em>utility function</em>, which in the case of network games depends both on their own actions and the actions of their neighbours.</p> <p><em>Equilibrium actions</em> refer to a set of strategies where no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In other words, at equilibrium, each player’s strategy is optimal, given the strategies of the other players. In network games, the equilibrium actions depend on the graph structure, along with other parameters dependent on the game.</p> <p>Consider, for example, a scenario where individuals on a social network can decide how much time to spend on the platform. In such a case, their behaviours may be influenced by their friends on the network, which creates a strategic interdependence between players. For instance, if Joe’s friends spend a lot of time on the platform, Joe might perceive a greater benefit from using the platform himself.</p> <p>In a different setting, Joe is a user of an e-commerce platform deciding whether to buy a book. If his friend has already purchased the book, Joe might be less likely to buy it, as he can borrow it from his friend. These examples illustrate how actions in network games can be affected by the actions of neighbouring players, leading to strategic interdependence and the emergence of equilibrium actions.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_examples-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_examples-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_examples-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_examples.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Examples of network games.

However, in many situations, the underlying network structure is not directly available to us. Instead, we may only observe the equilibrium actions that result from the interactions between agents. In these cases, a crucial question is whether we can reconstruct the network structure based solely on these equilibrium actions. Knowing the network structure can be helpful in predicting behaviour and planning network-based interventions, such as marketing campaigns or information diffusion.</p> <p>It was previously shown that, under specific assumptions about the mathematical form of the utility function and game types, it is possible to reconstruct the graph governing the network game<d-cite key="leng2020learning"></d-cite>. However, such assumptions can be unrealistic, especially when little is known about the game being played. To address this, in a recent paper<d-cite key="rossi2022networkgames"></d-cite> we developed an approach that does not require assumptions about the form of the utility function and can be applied to a broad range of network games.</p> <p>We start by studying three common types of network games, <em>Linear Quadratic</em>, <em>Linear Influence</em>, and <em>Barik-Honorio</em><d-cite key="barik2020provable"></d-cite>. The three types of games differ by the form of the utility function, leading to different levels of smoothness of the actions in the graph.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_types-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_types-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_types-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/blog/network_games/network_games_types.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Specific instances of three different types of games common in the game theory literature. The colours represent the actions taken by the players, which in this case are continuous values normalised between -1 and 1.</figcaption> </figure> <p>For example, <em>Linear Quadratic</em> games have the following utility function:</p> \[u_i = b_i x_i -\frac{1}{2} x_i^2 + \beta \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} a_{ij} x_i x_j\] <p>where \(x_i\) is the continuous action taken by player $i$, \(b_i\) is the player’s <em>marginal benefit</em>, \(\beta\) is a game parameter representing the strength of dependencies between actions of neighbours in the network, and \(a_{ij}\) is the entry in the adjacency matrix of the graph representing the strength of the connection between \(i\) and \(j\). The first term represents the marginal benefit for taking a larger action, the second (quadratic) term represents the cost for taking the action, while the third term represents the relation with the neighbours actions<d-footnote>If $\beta$ is positive, the incentive of a player to take a higher action is increasing in the number of their neighbours also taking a higher action, something referred to as a <i>strategic complement relationship</i>. On the other hand, if $\beta$ is negative the incentive of a player to take a higher action is decreasing in the number of their neighbours taking a higher action (<i>strategic substitute relationship</i>).</d-footnote>. Taking as example the aforementioned scenario of time spent on a social platform, the first term of the equation would capture the individual benefit from using the platform, such as staying up-to-date with the news, the second term would represent the cost from doing so, such as having less time to do other more important things, while the third term would capture the interdependence with the friends actions. In particular, \(\beta\) would be positive, as a person has an incentive to spend more time on the app if their friends (neighbours) do so.</p> <p>The pure-strategy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nash equilibrium</a> of <em>Linear Quadratic</em> games is:</p> \[\mathbf{x}^* = \big( \mathbf{I} - \beta \mathbf{A} \big)^{-1} \mathbf{b}\] <p>where \(\mathbf{x}\)* is a vector of dimension \(n\) (equal to the number of players, or nodes of the graph), \(\mathbf{A}\) is the unknown \(n \times n\) adjacency matrix of the graph, \(\mathbf{b}\) is the \(n\)-dimensional vector of marginal benefits of the players.</p> <p>Similar formulas can be derived for <em>Linear Influence</em> and <em>Barik-Honorio</em> games. A formula for the equilibrium actions \(\mathbf{x}^*\) that generalizes all three games has the form<d-footnote>In this formula, the choice $f(\mathbf{A})=(\mathbf{I} - \beta\mathbf{A})^{-1}$ and $h(\mathbf{b})=\mathbf{b}$ yields a Linear Quadratic game, $f(\mathbf{A})=\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ and $h(\mathbf{b})=\mathbf{b}$ a Linear Influence game, and $f(\mathbf{A})=\mathbf{u}_1$ (the largest eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$) and $h(\mathbf{b})=1$ a game of the Barik-Honorio type. </d-footnote></p> \[\mathbf{x}^* = \mathcal{F} (\mathbf{A}) \mathcal{H} (\mathbf{b})\] <p>where the function \(\mathcal{F} (\mathbf{A})\) accounts for the influence from the actions of one’s neighbours in the network and encodes the specific utility function of the game, and conversely, \(\mathcal{H} (\mathbf{b})\) is only affected by one’s characteristics, such as the marginal benefit of an individual player.</p> <p>In the paper we further show<d-footnote>Section 3.3 in our paper<d-cite key="rossi2022networkgames"></d-cite>.</d-footnote> that the players’ actions contain information about the spectrum of the graph, confirming that it is possible to reconstruct the graph structure from only the actions and justifying our approach outlined below.</p> <h2 id="machine-learning-approach">Machine Learning Approach</h2> <p>To tackle the problem of inferring the network structure of a game, we approach it as a machine learning problem. We train a model to map the players’ actions to the network structure of the game, without any prior knowledge of the underlying utility function. To achieve this, we gather a dataset of actions and network pairs (\(\mathbf{x}\), \(\mathbf{A}\)) from games played with the same utility function (although this function is unknown to us). This allows us to avoid making strong assumptions about the utility function and instead train a model that is agnostic to it.</p> <p>Such an approach is particularly useful in scenarios where social network and decision data exist for a small population, and we aim to learn the mapping from decisions to the network structure of a larger population. For instance, governments, public agencies, and researchers can collect social network data on a small population by asking individuals to nominate their friends, and then use the proposed method to learn the network interactions for a larger population in a cost-effective manner.</p> <p>Our ML model has an encoder-decoder architecture that is invariant to the permutation of both the players and the games, corresponding to the rows and columns of the \(n \times K\) matrix \(\mathbf{x}\), where \(k\) denotes the number of games. To achieve this, we modify a Transformer model, which is naturally permutation-invariant over the set of nodes but not over the set of games.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/network_games/model.svg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/blog/network_games/model.svg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Diagram representing the encoder-decoder architecture of our model.

This is done by taking the dot product of the two vectors for each game and summing the results before feeding them into a multilayer perceptron (MLP):</p> \[\hat{a}_{ij} = \psi\left(\sum_{k} \mathbf{z}_{ik} \odot \mathbf{Z}_{jk}\right)\] <p>where \(\odot\) represents the dot product and \(\psi\) is a 2-layer MLP.</p> <p>The resulting model is permutation-invariant over the set of games. This means that it produces the same predicted adjacency matrix regardless of the order in which the games are presented. To achieve this, the model computes separate node embeddings for each game and aggregates them through summation, which is a permutation-invariant operation. In practice, this property of the model ensures that we obtain consistent and reliable predictions, regardless of how the input data is ordered.</p> <h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental Results</h2> <p>We conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach in learning the network structure from players’ actions, using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Two authors of the paper (Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo) went on to receive the 2019 Economics Nobel prize.</d-footnote> and the <em>Yelp Ratings</em> dataset<d-footnote><a href="https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yelp Open dataset</a>.</d-footnote>. The former contains data from a survey of social networks in 75 villages in India. Each village constitutes a social network graph, where nodes are households and edges are self-reported friendships. We consider as actions the number of rooms, number of beds and other decisions families have to make related to their household. The reasoning is that if neighbours adopt a specific facility, villagers tend to gain higher payoff by doing the same, i.e., complying with social norms.</p> <p>The <em>Yelp Ratings</em> dataset consists of user ratings of businesses and social connectivity between users. We extracted 5000 sub-graphs representing communities from the raw data, where the actions were the average rating of users for 22 categories of businesses.</p> <p>On both real-world datasets, NuGgeT outperforms previous methods, showcasing the efficacy of our approach in cases where the game utility is not explicitly known. The gain is particularly large on the <em>Indian Villages</em> dataset, where the competing DeepGraph method fails to learn altogether. We conjecture this is due to NuGgeT being more data-efficient thanks to its built-in invariances, as confirmed by the above ablation over the number of training graphs.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/network_games/table_results-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/network_games/table_results-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/network_games/table_results-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/blog/network_games/table_results.png" class="img-fluid" width="500px" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">The table reports ROC AUC on the test set.

By developing a new machine learning approach to infer network structure from observed game outcomes, we show the potential for utilising game theory ideas to enhance machine learning and vice versa. Looking forward, there is ample opportunity to explore further connections between network games and graph neural networks, paving the way for more exciting developments in these fields.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/2023-04-20-network_games.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Emanuele Rossi.
