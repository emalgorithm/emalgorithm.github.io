GNNs have been successfully applied to model systems of relation and interactions in a variety of different domains, including social science, computer vision and graphics, particle physics, chemistry, and medicine. Until recently, most of the research in the field has focused on developing new GNN models and testing them on small graphs (with Cora, a citation network containing only about 5K nodes, still being widely used [1]); relatively little effort has been invested in dealing with large-scale applications…—-2An archive of data science, data analytics, data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence writing from the former Towards Data Science Medium publication.DeepMind Professor of AI @Oxford.
