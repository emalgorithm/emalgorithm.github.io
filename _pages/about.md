I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher at [Vant AI](https://www.vant.ai/), where I focus on **generative models for structural biology and drug discovery**. Our team recently introduced **[Neo-1](https://www.vant.ai/neo-1)**, an all-atom multimodal and multi-task latent diffusion model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in both structure prediction and de-novo generation of biomolecules.

I earned my PhD from Imperial College London, working on **Graph Neural Networks** under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein). During my PhD, I also worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter, focusing on both foundamental research and applied product problems. Prior to that, I was part of Fabula AI, a startup creating deep learning technology for fake news detection, subsequently [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai) in 2019. My educational background includes an undergraduate degree from Imperial College London and a master's degree from the University of Cambridge, both in Computer Science.

Outside of machine learning, you'll find me scuba diving, hiking trails, or simply enjoying quiet moments in nature.
