I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined [Vant AI](https://www.vant.ai/) as a Machine Learning Researcher. Vant combines a compelling ML vision with a proprietary data generation platform, focusing on the novel field of molecular glues. I'll be developing generative models for structural biology to advance the drug discovery process ðŸš€
