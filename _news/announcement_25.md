I’m excited to share that I will join the [Gladia Group](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) at Sapienza University of Rome as a Postdoc, working with [Emanuele Rodola](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/authors/rodola/).

My research will explore how ML can help decode animal communication, and how this pursuit can, in turn, inspire the next generation of ML methods 🐬
